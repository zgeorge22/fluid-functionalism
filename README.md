# Fluid Functionalism

Refined UI components with satisfying hover. Built on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and Radix primitives — every transition exists to make a state change legible.

## Install

Add the registry to your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest registry add @fluid
```

Then install any component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @fluid/button
```

Or install directly without adding the registry:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://www.fluidfunctionalism.com/r/button.json
```

Dependencies resolve automatically. Font weight animations require the [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) variable font.

## What makes these different

- **Motion as information** — transitions make state changes legible, nothing moves for decoration
- **Hover as preview** — proximity highlights show where your action will land before you click
- **Spring physics** — springs replace fixed durations, adapting naturally to interruption
- **Drop-in compatible** — your existing shadcn theme and tokens apply automatically
